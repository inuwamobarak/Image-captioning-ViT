This repository contains a project that explores the task of image captioning using Vision Transformers (ViTs). The project aims to generate descriptive captions for images by combining the power of Transformers and computer vision. It leverages state-of-the-art pre-trained ViT models and employs techniques such as attention mechanisms and language modeling to generate accurate and contextually relevant captions.

## Introduction
Image captioning is a challenging problem that involves generating human-like descriptions for images. By utilizing Vision Transformers, this project aims to achieve improved image understanding and caption generation. The combination of computer vision and Transformers has shown promising results in various natural language processing tasks, and this project explores their application to image captioning.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of paired image-caption data. Each image is associated with one or more descriptive captions. The dataset is not included in this repository, but you can find popular image captioning datasets such as MS COCO, Flickr30k, or Conceptual Captions for experimentation.
